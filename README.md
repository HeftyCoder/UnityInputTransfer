# Unity Input Transfer Framework

Prototype Framework for passing input data from a phone (or a generic device) to another device. Tested in Unity 2020.3 LTS with an Android Device and a Hololens. Should work in newer versions, but at the time of testing, these versions were unstable for MR when regarding Hololens.
