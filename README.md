# Unity Input Transfer Framework

Prototype Framework for passing input data from a phone (or a generic device) to another device. Original built in Unity 2020.3 LTS using an Android Device, a PC or a Hololens. Since then, the project has been updated to Unity 2022.3 LTS, but should work in 2021.3 LTS. 

The functionality of ArUco Tracking has been removed from the current version. If there is time, it will be added again.

What it DOES: Sends input through the network between two Unity applications using [Unity's Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/Installation.html). Ideal for easily passing data from your phone (sensors etc.) to another device.

What it DOESN'T: It's not meant to replace the typical way of using the Input System for local multiplayer or Unity's Networking for multiplayer.
